# digraph-kings-study
a computational study on king-vertices in products of directed graphs; the products of interest are Cartesian, strong, 
lexicographic, and direct-- the last of which is the main focus of this project; the inspiration of this project draws
heavily from [1]

## purpose
this project aims to identify how king-vertices in the factors of direct products affect the existence of kings in the
product; it's generally understood how king-vertices in the factors of cartesian, strong, and lexicographic products 
affect kings in each of their respective products; in direct products this is less understood, thusly we hope to
identify properties of factor graphs that lead to specific characteristics in their direct products, and possibly 
vice-versa

## technologies-used
- `Python 3.12`; chosen for ease of work, and available packages
- `NetworkX`; https://networkx.org/

## installation
this project makes use of both `Python`, and the `NetworkX` package, you will need both before attempting to run the project
code; no further installation steps (presumably) are required beyond having the above two items operational on your system

Thank you to Vancouver Island University for funding this research project, and to the Math Department, and Cobus for 
giving me the opportunity to gain valuable experience in pursuing research. I'm sure the skills I'm gaining will carry 
through to all my future research projects.
